# Prism Launcher Setup Guide:

### I made this folder so hopefully you can be using a better launcher and not have to deal with all the struggles of installing everything yourself.

### I placed all the necessary files to get you going without hopefully any hangups :) 


> Follow These Steps
>>

>>1. **Run the OpenJDK17 file**  
    (this installs the right version of Java Dev Kit to run 1.20)
>>2. **Run the Prism Launcher install.**  
    (Obviously this is to install the launcher but just in case you were confused)  
       setup should be pretty straight forward but if you run into any issues here is a link to their downloads page  and you can probably get some info there  https://prismlauncher.org/download/
>>3. **Once installed, go ahead and sign in to your minecraft account** *(top right of the window)*  
    (This should give you a link to open in your browser and then you put in the Numbers given in Prism Launcher to connect your microsoft account)
	--this is important to be able to play online--
>>4. **Within the Prism Launcher, click "Add Instance"** *(top left)*
>>5. **From here you're going to want to click "Import from zip"** *(second option on the left side)*   
>>6. **Select the "1.20.1" zip file located in this folder**  
>>7. **After this is complete the instance should be available on the main screen in Prism Launcher and from there you should be able to run it.** 



### P.S. You will have to set your controls, audio and video setting to your liking. There isn't much else from there.  

- *The minecraft video setting menu will look different and might take some poking around to find the settings you're looking for but I assure you it's much more intuitive than the original Minecraft Launcher menus*  
# 
#
# Resource Packs 

- ### I also included some resource packs in here that I really like (You'll have to enable them in the main settings menu options)

## **Here's a little run down of what each one does:**  

  **Fabric Mods**: This is necessary for this instance of minecraft to enable the preinstalled mods. Nothing overwhelming but just what it needs.

  **Brush-Up**: A cool retexturing of some of the items. Doesn't stray too far from the default minecraft look, just spruces it up a bit.

  **Fresh Animations**: This one gives all of the mobs fun and cool animations. Not necessary but kinda fun.
# 
#
# Shaders
### The shaders option is in the *top right* of the video settings tab. From there you can enable/disable shaders.
## The Shaders I included is *Complimentary Reimagined*
### Completely optional if you want to use them. May use a lot of GPU Resources and affect performance. 
- To disable them just click the **Shaders: Enabled** option at the top of the list.
  - This will disable all shaders and you will now have the default Minecraft look.
