# Prism Launcher Setup Guide:

### I made this Guide so hopefully you can be using a better launcher and not have to deal with all the struggles of installing everything yourself.

## **Download These First**
>### **Prism Launcher** --> https://prismlauncher.org/download/
> - You'll need to select the appropriate version for your system.
>   - **installer** installs it locally / **portable** keeps everything in one folder (you can put it on a thumb drive and use it on multiple devices)
>   - for most cases it's easier to just use the installer unless you play minecraft on multiple computers
> ### **OpenJDK17** --> https://adoptium.net/
> - Download the latest LTS Release here
> ### **ModPack File** --> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDI4NPdal9VhIMRXnsbhsgEc9bIGcesK/view?usp=sharing
> - This contains Minecraft 1.20.1 and some of the mods / resources described below
### 


### **Follow These Steps**
>

>1. **Run the OpenJDK17 file**  
    (this installs the right version of Java Dev Kit to run 1.20)
>2. **Run the Prism Launcher install.**  
    (Obviously this is to install the launcher but just in case you were confused)  
       setup should be pretty straight forward but if you run into any issues here is a link to their downloads page  and you can probably get some info there  https://prismlauncher.org/download/
>3. **Once installed, go ahead and sign in to your minecraft account** *(top right of the window)*  
    (This should give you a link to open in your browser and then you put in the Numbers given in Prism Launcher to connect your microsoft account)
	--this is important to be able to play online--
>4. **Within the Prism Launcher, click "Add Instance"** *(top left)*
>5. **From here you're going to want to click "Import from zip"** *(second option on the left side)*   
>6. **Select the "UntouchableMC " zip file located in this folder**  
>7. **After this is complete the instance should be available on the main screen in Prism Launcher and from there you should be able to run it.** 



### P.S. You will have to set your controls, audio and video setting to your liking. There isn't much else from there.  

- *The minecraft video setting menu will look different and might take some poking around to find the settings you're looking for but I assure you it's much more intuitive than the original Minecraft Launcher menus*

# Resource Packs 

- ### I also included some resource packs in here that I really like (You'll have to enable them in the main settings menu options)

## **Here's a little run down of what each one does:**  
>
>  ### **Fabric Mods**
> This is necessary for this instance of minecraft to enable the preinstalled mods. Nothing overwhelming but just what it needs.
>
>  ### **Brush-Up**
>  A cool retexturing of some of the items. Doesn't stray too far from the default minecraft look, just spruces it up a bit.
>
>  ### **Fresh Animations**
>  This one gives all of the mobs fun and cool animations. Not necessary but kinda fun.
# Shaders
### The shaders option is in the *top right* of the video settings tab. From there you can enable/disable shaders.
## The Shaders I included is *Complimentary Reimagined*
### Completely optional if you want to use them. May use a lot of GPU Resources and affect performance. 
- To disable them just click the **Shaders: Enabled** option at the top of the list.
  - This will disable all shaders and you will now have the default Minecraft look.
# Mods
## Some mods are installed for better performance or quality of life. Most of them will do things in the background but there is one that you can actually use within the game that I find helpful
> ### **Mouse Wheelie**
> - When hovering over items you can scroll up and down to send single items up and down.  
> - When holding shift alongside you may send whole stacks of items.  
> - When holding control alongside you can move all stacks of the same type of item.  
> - When you're in scrollable inventories you might want to press alt to prevent scrolling items.  
> - When you're sending items via shift-leftclick you can now hold both buttons to send all stacks you're hovering over  
> - Hold alt-leftclick to drop items quickly.  
> - When you're in the creative inventory and hover over the tab icons you can scroll through all the creative tabs and pages.  
> - In your facourite recipe books you can  
> - hover over the recipe grid to scroll through the pages.  
> - hover over the recipe group tabs to scroll through them.  
> - Sort inventories by clicking with your mouse wheel (you can also define an own keybinding)  
> - sorts by raw id (will most likely group by mods and similar items)  
> - hold shift while clicking to sort by quantity  
> - hold control while clicking to sort by alphabet  
> - You can customize which sort modes you prefer  
> - Press the swap key in any inventory to swap with the offhand  
> - Let your slots be automagically refilled from your inventory!  
> - Pick the matching tools for blocks by either sneaking while picking the block or by holding a tool. (this is configurable)  
> - Right-click trades or recipes to directly apply the crafting. When holding shift it will craft/trade a full stack
