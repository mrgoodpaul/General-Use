# Server Info and Tips
## URL: **untouchable.forgeserv.net**
## Dynamic Map: **https://untouchable.forgeserv.net/**
- ^ This is a map of the entire explored area, online player locations, and warp locations.
### We have added some quality of life commands and functionality to the server. You are able to use these as often and as freely as you like.<br>
#
# Basic Gameplay Functionality
### For the most part we left most of the game vanilla for simplicity and a lower barrier to entry for newer incoming players. There are some data packs installed for better quality of life and player item protections.
#
## **Data Packs**
> ### **Timber**:
>   - Instantly Breaks trees and drops all of the materials on the ground
>   - Works when normally breaking a Log block, If you only want to break one Log block, sneak while breaking.
>       - **Warning:** If your build is made out of Logs, there is a chance breaking one of them will break any connected logs. To avoid this, Sneak first and break it.
>
> ### **Armored Elytra**:
>   - Combines Elytra and Chestplate so you can have both equipped at the same time.
>   - **Using:** 
>       - Drop Elytra and Chestplate on top of any Anvil and they will automatically be combined.
>       - Burning *Netherite* armored Elytra will keep the chestplate but burn the elytra.
>   - Durability shown is Elytra Durability, *not* chestplate durability so best practice is to use this on a set that has the Mending enchantment.
> ### **Graves**
>   - Leaves a grave at the location you died at. Right clicking with an empty hand drops all of the items you had in your inventory when you died.
> ### **Confetti Creepers**
>  - A chance that creepers will explode with confetti and do no damage.
> ### **Wandering Trades**
> - Gives Wandering Traders more available trades than vanilla.
> ### **Player Head Drops | More Mob Heads**
> - Chance that any mob/player that is killed will drop a head item.
> ### **Unlock all Recipes**
> - Allows you to see all possible recipes without having to unlock them 
> ### **Cauldron Concrete**
> - Drop Concrete Powder in to a cauldron filled with water to instantly harden it
#
